## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm alxhu / Alex, 24 years old and live in Germany. I prefer she/her, but you can use any pronoun.

- My main programming language is C#.
- I love Open Source ðŸ’•
- I selfhost some things.
- I tend to buy domains even though I don't use them.

GitHub suggested to post a fun fact in this README, so here we go: While doing an internship abroad for three weeks in Bristol, the Google StreetView car caught me twice. (To be honest, this was way more cool when StreetView wasn't available in Germany.)
